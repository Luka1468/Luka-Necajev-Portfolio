                    My Name is Luka Necajev. I enjoy troubleshooting and finding problems within various hardwares like Routers, Switches, Servers and Computers.
                    I am currently studying in Sheridan College, completing the Computer Software and Network Engeneering Advanced Diploma.
                   In my spare time I try to keep myself busy by continuing to learning about the new and upcoming network theories and programming languages.
                   I am also planning to fininsh my studying for the Cisco CCNA Certificate by the end of the year. I believe my knowledge and experience with networks
                   to be very exiting. I believe the two most important features to have are being a hard worker and haveing a competative drive to learn about everything.

                    Working at Sheridan I realized how vast and interesting the networking world really is.
                     I learned how to configure and set up layer two devices and how to maintain the network.
                     I was working in ISG Infrastructure Solutions Group, This group included a very welcoming and 
                     knowledgable team. I was able to learn about how Sheridan sets up their networking equipment
                     What devices and protocols they are using and why they set up the distribution switches 
                     and ASR's in that specific way. Working at Sheridan I was able to get hands on experience replacing, troubleshooting
                     and diagnosing different problems with Differnt Cisco Switches, Access Points and different Wi-Fi related issues.

                    Working at Evertz I gained the experience and knowledge to troubleshoot different servers,
                     network devices, softwares, even got to create Ethernet and Coax cables as well as solder
                      and fix hardware on devices. I was a lab rat for the first 4 months, showing me the in's 
                      and outs of setting up datacenter equipment and setting up networks using Evertz Routers
                      and Arista Switches. While working part time, I was given a roll to start proggramming 
                      with Python. Me and my supervisor created a type of plugin for TestRail, that allows us to 
                      automate testing of Evertz devices using an HTTPS Server to be a buffer between the two.

                    In school I learned the basics of networks and their security. I realized that I really enjoyed learning about how networks work and what devices should be deployed where.
                    Since that course I have been reading up and broadening my knowledge by reading books like "CCNA Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, 7th Edition",
                    "Data Communications and Networking", "CompTIA Network+ Certification Exam Guide"
                    I am currently working towards getting my Cisco CCNA and CompTIA Network+ Certificate. I plan to finish it shortly after my last semseter at sheridan which ends at the end of the year.
                    I also want to get the CompTia A+ Certificate as well as look into ethical hacking and computer security some more.
