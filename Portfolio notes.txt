Hi Luka,
Thank you for sending your portfolio. It looks really good. I like your clean design.

I notice your profile photo is not proportional on different screen width. 

I'd like to see more description, diagrams and source codes on each project.
 I believe you are going to add one by one. 
Keep in mind that people will see other than your programming skill from your website,
 such as your organization skill, communication skill, quality of work, etc.
